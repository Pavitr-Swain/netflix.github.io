ðŸš€ Big Personal Win Today!

Just wrapped up a crazy productive day diving into:

C

HTML/CSS

SQL

JavaScript

Also been deep in the grind with Python, solving over 127 problems so far ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥

Some quick stats Iâ€™m low-key proud of:

âœ… 249 problems solved across multiple languages

ðŸ’¡ Beat 91.84% of users in recent challenges

ðŸ§  Growing my skills in Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Union Find, and more

ðŸ“Š Consistently learning through LeetCode, clocking in 512 submissions over the past year

ðŸ“ˆ Current streaks, badges, and a daily habit thatâ€™s finally paying off

Today was all about:

Method chaining

Data reshaping (pivot, melt, concat)

DataFrame tricks

Good olâ€™ problem-solving from arrays to good triplets

Not sharing this to flex â€” just feeling grateful for the momentum and wanted to drop a little checkpoint here to stay accountable and maybe inspire someone else to keep going ðŸ’ª

If you're grinding too, whether you're just starting out or 1,000 problems deep â€” I see you ðŸ‘€ Stay at it. Weâ€™re all getting better, one line at a time.
